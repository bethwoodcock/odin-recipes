# odin-recipes

Using the skills that I have learnt so far, I created a simple recipe site. This involved:

Using 'touch' to create new files for the web pages.

Filling out the files with '!' boilerplate and header tags. 

Using 'mkdir' to create a new directory for the 'recipes' and 'photos' folders. 

Linking to the recipe pages from the index.html page.

Creating content for the recipe pages including ordered and unordered lists, photos, and text. 

Publishing the site to Github Pages
